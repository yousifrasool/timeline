                Though the early 1900s introduced many popular works of comedic literature, such as The Importance of Being Earnest by Oscar Wild, and Psmith, Journalist by P.G. Wodehouse, the era is most notable for the rise of cinema, and silent film comedies also known as slapsticks, with Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, and Harold Lloyd becoming major stars. These films relied on visual gags and physical humor for laughs and often featured creative stunts and set pieces. Burlesque was also a popular form of live entertainment that often included explicit humor, risque costumes, and musicals. Burlesque comedy was known for its satirical take on current events. Ethnic comedy was also common during the early 1900s, featuring comedians who used stereotypes and caricatures of different ethnic groups for comedic effects such as blackface.             </p>
