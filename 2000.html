                Sketch comedy also remained popular in the 1990s, with shows like "Saturday Night Live" and "In Living Color" featuring memorable characters and skits. The rise of cable television also allowed for more experimental sketch shows like Mockumentaries such as "The Office" and "Arrested Development." These shows used a documentary-style format to parody the conventions of sitcoms. The 1990s saw a boom in animated comedies, with shows like "The Simpsons," "Beavis and Butt-Head," and "South Park" becoming hugely popular. These shows often featured irreverent humor and biting social commentary and helped push the boundaries of what was considered acceptable for mainstream television. The 2000s saw a resurgence in improvisational comedy, with shows like "Whose Line Is It Anyway?" and "Curb Your Enthusiasm" becoming popular. Improv-based comedy was also prominent in films. Sitcoms were still and are still popular to this day. The early 2000s saw the emergence of online comedy, with sites like Funny or Die and CollegeHumor launching and gaining popularity. Online videos and sketches, as well as comedic blogs and podcasts, provided new outlets for aspiring comedians and helped expand the reach of comedy to a global audience.            </p>
