                During the Victorian era, comedy was primarily enjoyed through live theater performances. Pantomime was a type of musical comedy that features exaggerated physical humor and audience participation, Pantomimes often featured well-known fairy tales and stories, with characters like the pantomime dame, the principal boy, and the pantomime horse becoming staples of the genre. In addition, to live theater, comedic literature also played a significant role in the Victorian comedy. The era saw the rise of the comedic novel, with writers like Charles Dickens. Cartoons and articles were also a popular way to make political jokes that poked fun at the upper classes and political figures of the time. These works often used wordplay and irony to comment on issues and expose societal hypocrisy.
